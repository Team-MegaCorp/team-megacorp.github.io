    The corporate cats at UniCorp have stolen your jams for their own profit! 
    Use tight, rhythmic, 3D platforming to explore a city block in the Cyberpunk world of the year 21XX, 
    jumping and dashing to the beat of your own tracks. Scare away the UniCorp agents to reclaim your 
    songs, adding them to your arsenal of movement-boosting cassettes used in your jailbroken UniCorp SongMachine 2.

  <h2>More Details</h2>

    <h5 class = "p-text">
      In the year 21XX, a heavily corporatized and technologically advanced city block is lit up with artificial lights and corporate 
      propaganda. The protagonist, an indie music producer who goes by the tag “JamCorp”, rebels against this oppressive world. With a 
      rebellious and bold 80s inspired style and love for authentic sound, she faces off against UniCorp’s evil corporate cats, who sell 
      soulless music for greedy monetary gain. At the start of the game, these cats steal her cassette tapes to sell as their own, 
      leaving the world eerily silent. Determined to reclaim her songs, JamCorp pursues these cats and is able to reclaim one of her tapes.
      JamCorp must now find the rest of her tapes, scattered across the city block. 
    </h5>

    <h5 class = "p-text">
      Gameplay revolves around rhythmic 3D platforming where 
      players execute jumps, dashes, and other movements by timing their actions to the beat of their cassette tape music. Inputs that are 
      on the beat grant greater movement boosts, encouraging the player to enter a flow state and move in a satisfying way. The camera will 
      be a standard controllable 3rd person camera. As JamCorp reclaims her tapes, each cassette adds a new track to her jailbroken UniCorp 
      SongMachine 2, offering unique movement effects or boosts that the player can switch between by choosing a different song. The player 
      will have to strategically activate these tracks to access new areas of the level.
    </h5>
    </br> 
    <h5 class = "p-text">
      The emotional experience is one of rebellion, 
      rhythm, and flow. Empowered to fight against the corporation and reclaim JamCorp’s stolen songs, players will feel a sense of triumph 
      and style.
