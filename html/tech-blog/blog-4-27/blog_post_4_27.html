  <h1>Tech Update from Sunday, 4/27/25</h1>

  <h3>Week Summary</h3>  

  <br/>
  <h4>Implementation Week!</h4> 
  <p>
    This week our primary focus has been on laser-focusing implementation of art assets and preparation for the Beta release.
    Significant efforts were put into adapting to playtesting feedback as well, with tweaks to some mechanics to address concerns.
    Our implementation included a focus on art assets, bringing in animations, textures, and final models for our NPCs and environment.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Animation State Machines</h4> 
  <p>
    As part of our efforts to get animations implemented, each NPC and our character required an animation state machine that would properly address
    the requirements of the game. This included getting a state machine for the character to include Jump and Dash animations, as well as NPC cat
    stae machines demanding randomization so not all the cats are synced up.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>On-Beat Fixes</h4> 
  <p>
    The biggest piece of feedback our team recieved regarding key mechanics was the punishing and off-beat nature of some of our rhythm elements.
    As this was our key mechanic we really wanted to address this feedback quickly. We went through the rhythm scripts and updated how we handled
    songs switching, as our rhythm manager was struggling to keep up with async calls to the wwise audio midware alongside the Quartz subsystem.
    This helped fix the structural issues with rhythm elements, and with better synced music to BPMs we were able to properly address the main issues
    causing desync with the player inputs.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>In-Engine Shader</h4> 
  <p>
    We implemented a CRT-style shader that creates a much more interesting visual experience. The CRT shader uses chromatic abberation and scanline flickering primarily.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Menu Controller Support</h4> 
  <p>
    A primary goal of our game is to allow for complete controller support, and while our in-game mechanics function with a controller properly the menus didn't.
    This has now been changed, and each menu now allows for proper controller input and navigation.
