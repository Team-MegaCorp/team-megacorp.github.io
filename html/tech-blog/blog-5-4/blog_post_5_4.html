  <h1>Tech Update from Sunday, 5/4/25</h1>

  <h3>Week Summary</h3>  

  <br/>
  <h4>Final Beta Preparations</h4> 
  <p>
    This week we focused on the final and polished implementations of core mechanics, ensuring that we had tuned the rhythm feelings well.
    Additionally, we wanted to work towards a complete gameplay experience, so finalizing the implementation of each of our assets was a big push.
    We implemented all sound effects, particles, and music into the game, adjusting each and the level design to fit with playtesting feedback.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Final Animations and Interactions</h4> 
  <p>
      Final animations were added, with each Cat being given a different randomized animation state out of a pool of unique idle animations.
      Additionally, the cats were linked up to have animations responsive to the player's interacitons with them.
      The interaction functions were also changed to fix bugs and present an easier interaction experience.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>On-Beat Fixes</h4> 
  <p>
    Another big week for rhythm fixes, we adjusted the period that the player is allowed to be "on-beat" in to fit on both sides of the beat frame,
    giving players more space while maintaining a level of on-beat difficulty that was reasonable.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>The Juice</h4> 
  <p>
      We wanted to make sure our game had really juicy and satisfying pieces, so a big effort this week was getting satisfying to be the keyword of our game.
      This included minor fixes to rhythm gameplay, design changes, and tuning the player movement to feel more responsive.
      We also added small details in sound effects to make the game feel more all-encompassing, getting rid of the old bit-wise sound effects for a more realistic and punky style.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Full UI Implementation</h4> 
  <p>
    We worked through each element of UI and added some small responsive features, as well as implementing all the UI art the art team had created.
