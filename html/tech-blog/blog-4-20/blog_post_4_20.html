  <h1>Tech Update from Sunday, 4/20/25</h1>

  <h3>Week Summary</h3>  

  <br/>
  <h4>Alpha Release Finalizing</h4> 
  <p>
    We spent a good chunk of the week finalizing our build for Alpha! The biggest challenge was handling our wwise integration in
    a build. We discovered that wwise demanded the project to be C++ enabled, something that our Blueprints only project was not.
    We worked around this by ensuring the project was set up for C++ builds.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>More Developed Dialogue</h4> 
  <p>
    It was important that the dialogue system be sufficient for the alpha build, so we spent time developing the system further.
    We wanted to make sure the NPCs would dissapear as we plan on preventing the player from collecting items until the dialogue is over.
    We also added particles and sound effects to mark the end of dialogue.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>On-Beat Particles</h4> 
  <p>
    The game now has a basic particle system that appears when the player provides an on-beat input. This was really important as we
    wanted to provide visual feedback on whether or not the player is on beat with the BPM of the current song. Although the particles
    are relatively basic, they still provide a level of feedback that didn't exist before and allow for faster implementation down the line.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Basic SFX implementation</h4> 
  <p>
    We added some basic sound effects to provide feedback on players input in general. This feedback allows for a more engaging experience,
    even though the sound effects are still in a basic state.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Updated Cassette Spins</h4> 
  <p>
    We made some additions to the Cassette Spin animation to make it both more visually appealing and stand out more in the level.
  </p>
