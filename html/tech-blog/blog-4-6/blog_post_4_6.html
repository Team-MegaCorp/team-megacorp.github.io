  <h1>Tech Update from Saturday, 4/6/25</h1>

  <h3>Week Summary</h3>  

  <br/>
  <h4> Casette Manager </h4>
  <p>
    The next manager we needed to implement is the casette manager. We decided that this manager would prevent
    bloating logic in the player blueprint and could manage casette progress and modifications. The player makes 
    calls to the casette manager to know the currently active casette and to swap between casettes. The manager 
    also tracks what casettes the player currently has.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4> Casette Objects </h4>
  <p>
    The next core element we implemented is the casette class. Casettes are the primary collectible in the game
    and they can modify the strength of player movements. Currently the casettes contain the modification values
    for the player moveset and they generate overlap events. They also have a bobbing up and down animation, and we are thinking
    of adding a spin animation as well. Their size will probably be increased as well. 
  </p>

  </br>
  <h4>Character-Cassette Interaction</h4>
  <p>
    We had to update the input action for swapping the player's cassettes, as its implementation worked for mouse and keyboard
    but it had issues on controller. It now works correctly on both, meaning the player can swap through their array of cassettes
    in both directions(left and right). The player also has a pick up cassette function which allows them to pick up casette objects.
  </p>

  </br>
  <h4>Character Actions on Beat</h4>
  <p>
    The character now only receives modifier benefits whenever they perform actions on beat. Changing the cassette changes these modifiers. 
    The timing window is fairly tight and will likely be revised with time.
  </p>

  </br>
  <h4>Early Shader Implementation</h4>
  <p>
    We implemented a pixelated filter for the game to give it a more distinct visual style. We will revise the shader more as we 
    continue implementing art assets, to ensure it is all cohesive.
  </p>

  </br>
  <h4>Music Implementation</h4>
  <p>
    We implemented a work in progress first cassette track to ensure that the wwise music implementation is working with the Rhythm
    Manager. There is desync issues with the Rhythm manager using the in game clock, so it will be transistioned over to a real time 
    clock. 
  </p>

  </br>
  <h4>Early Metrononome UI</h4>
  <p>
    There is a very basic visual metronome so that the player has a visual to refer to when trying to be on beat. As of right now it
    is a flashing circle centered on the bottom of the screen.
