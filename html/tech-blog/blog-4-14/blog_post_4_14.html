  <h1>Tech Update from Monday, 4/14/25</h1>

  <h3>Week Summary</h3>  

  <br/>
  <h4>Specific Casette Collectibles</h4> 
  <p>
    Using the casette class we created last week, we created specific derived children blueprints that will serve as the three
    main collectibles for the game. They are currently the dash cassette(dash improvement), the jump cassette(improves jump), 
    and the groove cassette(imrpoves both abilities to a lesser extent). We have given them initial modifier values, but these
    will probably change as we test what feels best to use for movement. The current intended order of collecting these
    cassettes is groove -> dash -> jump. We are considering make both the dash or jump accesible as soon as you have the groove 
    cassette though. 
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Early Cassette UI Implementation</h4> 
  <p>
    It is important for the player to have an easy to reference way to identify which cassette they currently have equppied so 
    we created an UI system that uses place holders assets for the time being. The UI is cycle type UI which reflects how the 
    player can change their casette by using a left or right input. Implementing this ui in the most natural way required adjusting
    how the equipped cassette is set in our cassette manager so that the UI could update the 'positions' of the cassettes. The ui
    assets will be updated with properly design ones later on, and if there is time some animation of the UI shifting left or right
    will look much nicer than the current instant swap.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Early Menu systems</h4> 
  <p>
    The game currently has an early implementation of the main menu and controls menus. The main menu can lead to the game scene, 
    controls menu, or quit the game. All ui will eventually be updated with nicer assets, but the goal is to keep these menus clean
    and easy to navigate. We also woud like to implement a simple pause menu, so that the player can easily return to the main menu 
    and quit the game.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Simple Dialogue System</h4> 
  <p>
    We implemented a simple dialogue system that could be used for npc interactions or just whenever we want to put text information
    in a clean way on the screen. It just includes text boxes with text that can be progressed at the press of a button. The player
    was also given an interaction zone to trigger interactions. All of these elements were tested on a test cat npc. 
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Dynamic Audio Update</h4> 
  <p>
    We have a relatively simple implementation of dynamic audio incorporated where the song that is playing changes when you enter a 
    dialogue sequence with the cat npcs. 
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Real Time Clock Fixes</h4> 
  <p>
    The Rhythm manager received another update that aims to improve the desync issues that we have encountered. The BPM system now
    uses the Unreal Engine quartz system which has provided the most accurate timing out of all of our implementations. Desync issues
    may still be present on a player to player basis, so we plan to implement a simple offset test system to account for this.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h4>Player Animation State Machine</h4> 
  <p>
    An early version of the player animation state machine has been implemented. Currently it only supports a blend space we created
    which adjusts a default animation based on the players velocity. This blend space relies on an idle, walk, and run animations. A 
    jump state was implemented, however the animation was removed for the time being as it did not sync well with our physics. In the 
    future we intend to find a jump animation for the characters jump, a falling animation for when the character is in the air, and 
    a dash animation. A landing animation would be useful if we find the time.
