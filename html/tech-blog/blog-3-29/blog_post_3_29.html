  <h1>Tech Update from Saturday, 3/29/25</h1>

  <h3>Week Summary</h3>

  <br/>
  <h4>Character Movement</h4>
  <p>We implemented the basic moveset of our character which includes which includes movement, 
    free camera control, a jump, and a dash. We also spent some time refining the movement with 
    snappier rotation, more control in air, and ensuring the dash is balanced between the air and 
    ground.
  </p>

  </br>
  <h4> Rhythm Manager </h4>
  <p>
    One of our major design goals is input on beat, so we worked on a Rhythm Manager which could be
    called to determine if actions were on beat or not. The Rhythm manager is implemented successfuly
    using the in game clock as of right now. 
  </p>

  <h4> Wwise Integration </h4>
  <p>
    Since we have a game with an emphasis on audio, our audio programmer intergrated wwise into the project.
    It was integrated in a manner such that only our audio programmer needs wwise installed and so long as
    each team member has the unreal wwise plugin, the project compiles fine.
